=== Normal Flow

.Update local from remote, push local commits
[source, console]
----
git checkout master     # switch to `master` branch and update working directory
git fetch --prune       # fetch from remote and remove local branches if removed from upstream
git rebase              # replay local commits ontop of updated local branch
git push origin master  # push current HEAD to remote master branch
----

`git pull` is shorthand for `git fetch` followed by `git merge FETCH_HEAD`. Use `git pull --rebase` to do a rebase rather than a merge.

.Update local from remote, merge local development branch
[source]
----
git checkout master     # Switches to `master` branch and updates the working directory
git pull                # to update the state to the latest remote master state
git merge develop       # to bring changes to local master from your develop branch
git push origin master  # push current HEAD to remote master branch
----


=== Configuration

Hierarchy of configuration levels:

|===
|Modifier |Location |Description

|`--local` |`.git/config` |local to a repo
|`--global`|`~/.gitconfig`|global to a user
|`--system`|`/etc/gitconfig`|system wide on OS
|===

Configuration keys are "dot"-delimited strings formed in a hierarchical fashion.

.Configuration
[source]
----
git config -l           # list configuration values (includes global)
git config --global -l  # list global configuration values (not local)

git config user.email   # list the configured value for key
git config user.email "1091512+gheinze@users.noreply.github.com"  # set email address

# set email address at user level (i.e. across repos)
git config --global user.email "1091512+gheinze@users.noreply.github.com"

git config --global core.editor "vim"
git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.hist "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"
git config --global http.proxy
git config --global https.proxy
----

***

You may wish to alias a remote. Or perhaps the name/location of the remote repo changed and you need to update the local configuration to reflect that.

.Remote
[source]
----
git remote -v      # list the remote repositories

# add a remote endpoint for current repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/gheinze/debenture.git

# Change the url of the remote endpoint
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/accounted4/toolbox

git remote show origin
----

As `origin` is just an alias for a url, you could specify the url directly rather than using the alias.
One can also add a `username:password` to the url.  Or just `username` to be prompted for the password.
Or use a credential manager for have the values looked up.

[source]
----
git fetch https://53gheinze@git.sonova.com/tloeg/sonovaDigitalCommerce master
----

=== Diffing

.Diff back one commit
[source]
----
git log -p -1 [<source> | <commit>]
----

=== Reverting

.Reverting
[source]
----
# Remove file from the index (i.e. the "about to be committed" area)
# without changing anything els (i.e. leave modified file modified in working dir)
git reset filename.txt

# Un-modify a file in the workspace
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Update both the working copy of `filename.txt` and its state in the index with that from HEAD
git checkout HEAD -- filename.txt
----

An example of pretending the last commit did not happen...

[source]
----
# Moving HEAD before the last commit
git reset --soft HEAD^   # moves HEAD to previous commit, doesn't touch index or work area
git push origin +master  # forces this push to master, orphaning the previous HEAD
----

A StackOverflow example:

[source]
----
git add -A; git commit -m "Start here."
git add -A; git commit -m "One"
git add -A; git commit -m "Two"
git add -A' git commit -m "Three"
git log --oneline --graph -4 --decorate

* da883dc (HEAD, master) Three
* 92d3eb7 Two
* c6e82d3 One
* e1e8042 Start here.

git reset --soft HEAD~3
git log --oneline --graph -1 --decorate

* e1e8042 Start here.

# Now all your changes are preserved and ready to be committed as one.
----


=== Rebasing

In the following example `feature1` is branched off of `master`.  `master` continues on. `feature1` continues on.
Now we want to replay the `feature1` commits on top of the new `master` HEAD.  Then we move the `master` HEAD to be
at the same location as `feature1` HEAD.  Essentially we are moving all the commits from `feature1` onto the
`master` branch.  If you want `feature1` commits squashed into a single commit to be added to the `master` branch,
then try merging instead of rebasing.

.feature branch
----
    master
     |
A -> D
  \
    B -> C
         |
      feature1
----

.rebase
----
    master   feature1
     |          |
A -> D -> B' -> C'
----

.merge
----
          master, feature1
                |
A -> D -> B' -> C'
----

.Rebasing
[source]
----
git commit                # on master [A]
git checkout -b feature1  # checkout feature1 (and create the branch if it doesn't exist)
git commit                # on feature1 [B]
git commit                # on feature1 [C]
git checkout master
git commit                # on master [D]
git checkout feature1
git rebase master         # replay feature1 commits ontop of current master to create revised feature1 [B', C']
git checkout master
git merge feature1        # since feature1 is linearly ahead of master now, move the head of master to head of feature1
----

=== Stashing

.Stashing
[source]
----
# Push local modifications to a new stash entry and roll back to HEAD (in working tree and index)
git stash push -m "My interrupted work"

git stash list
git stash pop

----

=== Amending

RULE:  *Don't append public commits.*

[source]
----
# Change the message of the last commit:
git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"

# Adding a missed file to the last commit: stage the missed file, then commit with:
# the "â€“no-edit" will prevent prompting for a commit message and keep it the same as the original commit.
git commit --amend --no-edit
----

Essentially, with ammend, you are avoiding moving HEAD with another commit.


=== Branching

[source]
----
# Create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature_branch_name

# Push your branch to the remote repository (`-u` for add upstream tracking reference):
git push -u origin feature_branch_name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete remote_branch_name
----

=== Tag

[source]
----
# Create a named tag
git tag gh_solrPoductSearchApiWithCompatibleProducts

# Push the tag to remote
git push --tags
----

=== Example: Merge feature into master

[source]
----
git checkout gh_removeLegacyUserManagement
git branch gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak  # create a backup reference
git log # determine number of commits from start of branch

# Put all the changes in the branch into one commit
# Go back to first commit of branch (in this case 2, or specify commit explicitly)
# Interactive editor will show "picks": change "pick" to "squash" for all subsequent commits
git rebase -i HEAD~2

# Put the single commit from the branch into master
git checkout master
git fetch
git rebase
git cherry-pick e3b8fee61c08eab6a8996ece167e06b901d55d52
git diff HEAD~1
git push

# Delete local branch:

git branch -d gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak
error: The branch 'gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak'.

$ git branch -D gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak
Deleted branch gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak (was 22da15c).

# Delete local and remote branch:
git push origin --delete gh_removeLegacyUserManagement
To https://git.sonova.com/tloeg/sonovaDigitalCommerce
 - [deleted]         gh_removeLegacyUserManagement

git branch -d gh_removeLegacyUserManagement
----


=== Notes


In GitHub, suffix a url with `#L18-L20` to highlight lines 18 - 20. Ex:

https://github.com/gheinze/asset-management/blob/master/a4-asset-manager/src/main/java/com/accounted4/assetmanager/Application.java#L9-L10


==== `--`

The special "option" `--` means "treat every argument after this point as a file name, no matter what it looks like." This is not Git-specific, it's a general Unix command line convention. Normally you use it to clarify that an argument is a file name rather than an option, e.g.

[source]
----
rm -f      # does nothing
rm -- -f   # deletes a file named "-f"
----

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6561142/difference-between-git-checkout-filename-and-git-checkout-filename

==== `HEAD`

`HEAD` is the commit at the top of the branch.

`HEAD~1` is the commit 1 previous to `HEAD`
