=== Normal Flow

.Update local from remote, push local commits
[source, bash]
----
git checkout master     # switch to `master` branch and update working directory
git fetch --prune       # fetch from remote and remove local branches if removed from upstream
git rebase              # replay local commits ontop of updated local branch
git push origin master  # push current HEAD to remote master branch
----

`git pull` is shorthand for `git fetch` followed by `git merge FETCH_HEAD`. Use `git pull --rebase` to do a rebase rather than a merge.

.Update local from remote, merge local development branch
[source, bash]
----
git checkout master     # Switches to `master` branch and updates the working directory
git pull                # to update the state to the latest remote master state
git merge develop       # to bring changes to local master from your develop branch
git push origin master  # push current HEAD to remote master branch
----


=== Configuration

Hierarchy of configuration levels:

|===
|Modifier |Location |Description

|`--local` |`.git/config` |local to a repo
|`--global`|`~/.gitconfig`|global to a user
|`--system`|`/etc/gitconfig`|system wide on OS
|===

Configuration keys are "dot"-delimited strings formed in a hierarchical fashion.

.Configuration
[source, bash]
----
git config -l           # list configuration values (includes global)
git config --global -l  # list global configuration values (not local)

git config user.email   # list the configured value for key
git config user.email "1091512+gheinze@users.noreply.github.com"  # set email address

# set email address at user level (i.e. across repos)
git config --global user.email "1091512+gheinze@users.noreply.github.com"

git config --global core.editor "vim"
git config --global merge.tool kdiff3
git config --global color.ui auto
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.hist "log --oneline --graph --decorate --all"
git config --global http.proxy
git config --global https.proxy
----

***

You may wish to alias a remote. Or perhaps the name/location of the remote repo changed and you need to update the local configuration to reflect that.

.Remote
[source, bash]
----
git remote -v      # list the remote repositories

# add a remote endpoint for current repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/gheinze/debenture.git

# Change the url of the remote endpoint
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/accounted4/toolbox

git remote show origin
----

=== Reverting

.Reverting
[source, bash]
----
# Remove file from the index (i.e. the "about to be committed" area)
# without changing anything els (i.e. leave modified file modified in working dir)
git reset filename.txt

# Un-modify a file in the workspace
git checkout -- filename.txt

# Update both the working copy of `filename.txt` and its state in the index with that from HEAD
git checkout HEAD -- filename.txt
----


=== Stashing

.Stashing
[source, bash]
----
# Push local modifications to a new stash entry and roll back to HEAD (in working tree and index)
git stash push -m "My interrupted work"

git stash list
git stash pop

----

=== Amending

RULE:  *Don't append public commits.*

[source, bash]
----
# Change the message of the last commit:
git commit --amend -m "an updated commit message"

# Adding a missed file to the last commit: stage the missed file, then commit with:
# the "â€“no-edit" will prevent prompting for a commit message and keep it the same as the original commit.
git commit --amend --no-edit
----

=== Branching

[source, bash]
----
# Create a new branch:
git checkout -b feature_branch_name

# Push your branch to the remote repository (`-u` for add upstream tracking reference):
git push -u origin feature_branch_name
----


=== Example: Merge feature into master

[source, bash]
----
git checkout gh_removeLegacyUserManagement
git branch gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak  # create a backup reference
git log # determine number of commits from start of branch

# Put all the changes in the branch into one commit
# Go back to first commit of branch (in this case 2, or specify commit explicitly)
# Interactive editor will show "picks": change "pick" to "squash" for all subsequent commits
git rebase -i HEAD~2

# Put the single commit from the branch into master
git checkout master
git fetch
git rebase
git cherry-pick e3b8fee61c08eab6a8996ece167e06b901d55d52
git diff HEAD~1
git push

# Delete local branch:

git branch -d gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak
error: The branch 'gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak'.

$ git branch -D gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak
Deleted branch gh_removeLegacyUserManagement_bak (was 22da15c).

# Delete local and remote branch:
git push origin --delete gh_removeLegacyUserManagement
To https://git.sonova.com/tloeg/sonovaDigitalCommerce
 - [deleted]         gh_removeLegacyUserManagement

git branch -d gh_removeLegacyUserManagement
----


=== Notes


In GitHub, suffix a url with `#L18-L20` to highlight lines 18 - 20. Ex:

https://github.com/gheinze/asset-management/blob/master/a4-asset-manager/src/main/java/com/accounted4/assetmanager/Application.java#L9-L10


==== `--`

The special "option" `--` means "treat every argument after this point as a file name, no matter what it looks like." This is not Git-specific, it's a general Unix command line convention. Normally you use it to clarify that an argument is a file name rather than an option, e.g.

[source, bash]
----
rm -f      # does nothing
rm -- -f   # deletes a file named "-f"

==== `HEAD`

`HEAD` is the commit at the top of the branch.

`HEAD~1` is the commit 1 previous to `HEAD`
